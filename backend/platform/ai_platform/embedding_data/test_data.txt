AI Agent for Academic Guidance
Project Overview
The primary way in which learners engage with content in the IITM BS degree program is through the SEEK portal. The portal contains learning videos, assignments, resources, practice and graded assignments, and programming quizzes. The portal can be described as a learning environment and provides opportunities for self-learning, by enabling learners to learn at their own pace and schedule.
Project Goals
With the rapid advancement of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, there are promising possibilities of effective integration of GenAI into these learning environments. The goal of this project is to develop an AI agent that enhances the learning experience for students enrolled in the IITM BS program.
Key Objectives
Serve as a virtual guide for students

Help students navigate course material

Improve student study habits

Promote adherence to academic integrity principles
Agent Characteristics
The agent will be designed with the following core principles:

No Direct Answers: Instead of providing solutions, the agent will:

Suggest relevant learning strategies

Direct students to reference materials

Guide students to appropriate course content

Course-Specific Guidance:

Dynamically reflect practice assignments and available resources

Use contextually relevant resources

Point students to credible academic references and official materials

Primary Focus: Support the student community and foster a collaborative learning environment
Technical Constraints
1. Standard Conversational Features
Conversation threading to maintain context across interactions

Artifacts storage for key interactions and recommendations

Adherence to rate limits and a defined context window
2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture
Implement a RAG system to handle common queries
Innovative Approach
The project encourages innovative solutions beyond the provided examples, focusing on enhancing student learning experiences through AI-powered guidance.
